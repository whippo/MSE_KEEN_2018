METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION	
_______________________________________	
	
Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:	Methods used were derived from the Kelp Ecosystem Ecology Network Experimental protocol (KEEN: https://github.com/kelpecosystems/). Specifically the experimental portion of the methods were used as described in the manual, with the exception of the number of plots. 6 total plots were created, 3 subjected to experimental kelp removal and 3 left as controls. A total of 4 quadrats of each type (UPC, open quadrat) were taken at the center of each plot. Data collected by Galloway and Lowe is to be considered the 'official' KEEN data taken out of Friday Harbor Labs. All data collected by other data collecters is reduntant student data to be used for comparative analysis.
